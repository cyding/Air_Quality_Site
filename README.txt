This air quality sample webpage displays the location of five different air quality stations in the United States and a 
link to a timeseries that shows the pollutant concentration values for each hour of a certain day.

By default, the air quality stations have a link to the timeseries for the pollutant Ozone on the current date.

If you want to change the date or parameter, type in the date and parameter in this format: yyyymmddPollutant.
For example, if you would like to see the ozone concentration for 09/07/2014, then type in 20140907Ozone. If you
would like the see the PM2.5 concentration for the same date, then type in 20140907PM2.5. 

For security reasons, you are not allowed to see the timeseries of each station. This webpage is just a design.
